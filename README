Xilinx XC9572XL Development Board
=================================

A development board and demo code for the Xilinx XC9572XL CPLD.

The board targets the PLC44 package in particular and is designed
in a way that it can be build with through hole parts on a perfboard.


Software
--------

The demo Verilog code in src/ toggle P1 at a frequency of about 0.75Hz
when using a 50MHz oscillator.


Hardware
--------

The development board was originally intended to be used in 5V systems,
e.g. with Arduinos or other AVR controllers powered by a 5V power
supply.
Therefore it includes a 5V to 3.3V voltage regulator and uses
a 5V crystal oscillator since that is the type most commonly 
available in a through-hole package.

For use in an 3.3V environment, e.g. with a Raspberry Pi or powered
directly from an Arduino's 3.3V line the voltage regulator can
be omitted but a 3.3V oscillator has to be used in that case!

IMPORTANT: The XC9500XL CPLDs are 3.3V devices with 5V tolerant
IOs. So if you make any changes to the design make sure to check
that the CPLD will actually work with your required voltage levels!!!
